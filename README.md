Sudamos is a simple Ruby on Rails P2P marketplace focussed in the spanish-sport 2nd hand niche. The app was initially implemented without the intention  thinking in the sudamos-business and not in being a good abstraction of what a P2P marketplace should be. However, for anyone who is starting a marketplace in Ruby on Rails, this repo could potentially be a useful start-point.

Write me a line if you want to use this platform in a production environment.
